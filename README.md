# Obstacle Factory Design Pattern in Java

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of the Abstract Factory design pattern in Java. The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This project simulates a scenario where different types of obstacles are created for different levels of a game.

## Design Patterns Covered

1. **Singleton Pattern** - Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

2. **Prototype Pattern** - Allows for the creation of new objects by copying existing objects (prototypes).

3. **Builder Pattern** - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

4. **Factory Method Pattern** - Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
